### Slide Title: **Rules Inference Engine Overview**

---

### **Introduction**

- Developed a rules inference engine to determine applied rules on input data for output generation.

### **Tools Used**

- **RIPPER (Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction)**
  - **Description**: Efficient rule induction algorithm focused on producing accurate and concise rules.
  - **Advantages**: Fast, handles noisy data well, produces human-readable rules.

- **gplearn (Genetic Programming in Python)**
  - **Description**: Evolutionary algorithm-based library for symbolic regression, used to evolve mathematical expressions.
  - **Advantages**: Flexibility in rule discovery, ability to handle complex patterns.

### **Other Available Options**

1. **C4.5 / C5.0**
   - **Description**: Algorithms for generating a decision tree developed by Ross Quinlan.
   - **Pros**: Good accuracy, handles categorical and continuous data, produces a decision tree.
   - **Cons**: Can create large trees, less interpretable rules compared to RIPPER.

2. **PART (Partial Decision Trees)**
   - **Description**: Combines C4.5 and RIPPER to generate partial decision trees.
   - **Pros**: Balances accuracy and simplicity, interpretable rules.
   - **Cons**: Slower than RIPPER, can be complex in certain datasets.

3. **Random Forest**
   - **Description**: Ensemble learning method for classification and regression using multiple decision trees.
   - **Pros**: High accuracy, robustness, handles large datasets.
   - **Cons**: Less interpretable, computationally expensive.

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Rule Extraction**
   - **Description**: SVM models with post-hoc rule extraction.
   - **Pros**: High accuracy, well-suited for high-dimensional data.
   - **Cons**: Complex extraction process, less interpretable.

### **Why RIPPER and gplearn are Best for Our Use Case**

- **Interpretability**
  - Both RIPPER and gplearn produce highly interpretable rules and mathematical expressions.
  
- **Performance**
  - RIPPER is efficient and handles noisy data well, making it suitable for varied datasets.
  - gplearn provides flexibility to discover complex patterns that other algorithms might miss.

- **Flexibility and Simplicity**
  - gplearn's genetic programming approach is flexible, allowing for a broader range of rule discovery.
  - RIPPER's pruning mechanism ensures concise and relevant rules.

- **Human-Readability**
  - The rules produced are easy for humans to understand and validate, which is crucial for transparency in decision-making.

### **Conclusion**

- Combining RIPPER and gplearn leverages the strengths of both algorithms, ensuring a robust, accurate, and interpretable rules inference engine.
